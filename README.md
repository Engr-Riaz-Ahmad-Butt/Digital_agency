# Digital_agency

A simple digital agency web project with separate `backend` and `frontend` folders.

## Project overview

- `backend/` — Node.js server (API, demo server). Contains `package.json` and `server.js`.
- `frontend/` — React-based frontend application. Contains source in `src/` and public assets in `public/`.

This repository contains the server and client for a digital agency landing site. The frontend is a React app and the backend is a Node.js server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS) and npm installed

## Run locally

Backend

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

If your frontend uses a different script (for example `npm run dev`), run that instead.

## Repository structure

- `backend/` — server code and dependencies
- `frontend/` — React app, components, assets, styles

## Contributing
